# Scripts for setup of network overlays

Steps necessary for setting up simple examples to test the following network overlays:
* Docker Networking
* Weave
* Flannel (UDP mode)
* Calico

The test were conducted with three virtual boxes on a local machine (ubuntu 15.10, 1 CPU, 2 GB RAM, bridged network interface) and docker version 1.9.1, build a34a1d5.
I'm considering providing vagrant/packer boxes for an even easier setup in the near future.
